# File-Based Data Sort and Filter

This repository demonstrates a Node.js application that fetches data from a file, sorts, and filters the data based on names. The application is designed for simplicity and efficiency, making it easy to extend and customize for various data processing tasks.

## Features

- **Fetch Data:** Reads data from a specified file.
- **Sort Data:** Sorts the data alphabetically based on names.
- **Filter Data:** Filters the data to include only entries that match a specific condition.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or later recommended).
- **Git**: Optional, for cloning the repository.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   If the project uses any external modules, install them using:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Prepare the Data File**:
   - Place your data file (e.g., `data.json`, `data.txt`) in the project directory.
   - Ensure the file format matches the expected structure (e.g., JSON or plain text).

4. **Run the Application**:
   - To execute the script, run:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```

## Project Structure

```
/project-folder
│
├── app.js           # Main application logic
├── data.json        # Example data file (replace with your own)
├── README.md        # Documentation file
└── package.json     # Node.js dependencies
```

## Example Input and Output

### Input (`data.json`)
```json
[
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 25 },
  { "name": "Bob", "age": 30 },
  { "name": "Charlie", "age": 20 }
]
```

### Output (Sorted and Filtered by Name)
```json
[
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }
]
```

## Customization

1. **Sorting Logic**: Modify the sorting function in `app.js` for custom sorting orders (e.g., descending order).
2. **Filtering Logic**: Adjust the filtering condition to include/exclude specific data entries.
